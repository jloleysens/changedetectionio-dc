                       Everything that I understand, I understand only because I love.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                       Leo Tolstoy (1828 - 1910) People might not get all they work for in this world, but they must certainly work for all they get.                                                                                                                                                                              
                       Frederick Douglass (1817 - 1895) The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended.
